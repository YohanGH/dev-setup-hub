# Contributing

Thanks for your interest! This repo is a centralised, opinionated set of dev configs.

## How to propose changes
1. Open an issue describing the change and rationale.
2. Fork and create a feature branch.
3. Keep commits small; include context in the PR description.
4. For scripts: add usage notes and a dry-run mode if relevant.

## Standards
- Follow the repo layout; avoid breaking changes to `profiles/*` without a migration note.
- No secrets in commits. Use `.env.example` to show variable names.
- Prefer POSIX-compliant shell in scripts unless a dependency is justified.

## Code of Conduct
By participating, you agree to abide by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
