# Unified Dev Configs

**One repo to hold all my dev environment configs — past, present, evolving.**  

## Why
- Centralise historical configs into a single evolving environment
- Make onboarding/rebuilds deterministic (fresh laptop = 30 min)
- Document opinions and trade-offs as practices mature

## What’s inside
- **/vscode/**: `settings.json`, `keybindings.json`, recommended extensions list
- **/shell/**: zsh/bash config, aliases, prompt, env exports
- **/setup/**: setup scripts for the environment
- **/headers/**: header scripts for the environment
- **/obsidian/**: obsidian configuration
- **/vim/**: vim configuration
